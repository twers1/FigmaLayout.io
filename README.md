You got a job at a successful tech startup. You have a team of cool techies working with you, the best in the business. In order to attract investors and spread the word about the company, you need to design a landing page - to turn a drawn layout into a working page using HTML and CSS.

[Layout in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BL7wdCOSIxYFu1uxctuVzg/Домашнее-задание-Pied-Piper?node-id=0%3A1) To view the layout interactively, sign up.

Some layout requirements and tips:

1)The header stays at the top of the screen when the page scrolls.

2)The content is nested in a block that is rigidly set to 1219px wide, with side padding of 55px each.

3)Clicking on the links in the header should take you to the appropriate sections of the page.

4)Clicking on the logo should take you to the top of the page.

5)Content within sections should be centered (use margin auto) so that on large screens it doesn't stick to the right edge. Try pressing Ctrl and - to zoom out in the browser. The layout on the right is how the page should display on a wide screen.


6)To arrange the blocks in a row, you can use display: inline-block.


__Try to avoid setting width and height manually. Most sizes can be expressed through margin and padding. The exceptions are images and fixed page container.
The position property can only be set for the header.
Include normalize.css in your page to make the original styles the same in all browsers__
